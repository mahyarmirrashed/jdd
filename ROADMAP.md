# Roadmap

- [x] Graceful shutdown and signal handling
  - Handle OS signals (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM) to gracefully stop the daemon, close watchers, and clean up resources
- [x] Configuration support
  - Allow configuring the watched directory, logging level, or other options via a config file or environment variables
- [x] Logging enhancements
  - Add structured logging with timestamps and log levels (info, warning, error) to help with debugging and monitoring
- [x] Error handling and recovery
  - Improve error handling so that transient errors (e.g., temporary file access issues) donâ€™t crash the daemon
- [x] Initial scan on startup
  - Perform an initial scan of the watched directory on startup to organize any existing files that match the Johnny Decimal pattern
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
  - Add tests for your parsing, folder creation, and watcher logic to ensure reliability during future changes
- [ ] Cross-platform capability
  - Test and ensure the daemon works on different OSes if needed
- [x] Daemonization and service integration
  - Use a library like `go-daemon` to run your daemon as a background service
- [ ] User feedback and notifications
  - Notify users on file moves or errors via desktop notifications or logs
  - Via something like `"github.com/gen2brain/beeep"`
